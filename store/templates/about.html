                <p> DSA is defined as a combination of two separate yet interrelated topics â€“ Data Structure and Algorithms. DSA is one of the most important skills that every computer science student must have. It is often seen that people with good knowledge of these technologies are better programmers than others and thus, crack the interviews of almost every tech giant.</p>
                <p>What is Data Structure?
                    A data structure is defined as a particular way of storing and organizing data in our devices to use the data efficiently and effectively. The main idea behind using data structures is to minimize the time and space complexities. An efficient data structure takes minimum memory space and requires minimum time to execute the data.</p>
